Big Data: 
	It is high volume, high velocity, and high variety information assets that requires new forms of processing to enable enhanced decision making ,insight, discovery and process optimization. Big data process using parallel processing or distributed processing  by distributive processing the data in multiple machines.

Batch processing:
	when data size is known and finite

Stream processing:
 when data is obtained in real time , infinite, unknown size and continuous

Lake House:
	 A lake house is a type of data architecture that combines the best elements of data lakes and data warehouses.

Pyspark, Python API for Apache spark:
	In memory distributed engine that allows you process data efficiently in a  distributed fashion

Capital Expenditure(Capex):
	• The upfront spending of money on spending physical infrastructure
	• Costs from CapEx have a value that reduces over time
Operational Expenditure (OpEx):
	OPEX refers to funds needed to run day-to-day operations.
